# Lab 22 â€“ Scheduling Python Scripts with Cron (Linux) / Task Scheduler (Windows)

## Objectives
- Automate the execution of Python scripts using system schedulers.
- Use cron on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows.
- Verify and troubleshoot scheduled tasks.

## Tasks
1. Write a Python script (`time_logger.py`) that appends the current time to `log.txt`.
2. Schedule it to run every minute (via `crontab -e` on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows).
3. Verify `log.txt` updates every minute.

## Conclusion
You learned how to automate Python scripts using cron/Task Scheduler for recurring tasks such as logging, backups, or monitoring.
