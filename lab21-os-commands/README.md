# Lab 21 â€“ Automation with OS Commands

## Objectives
- Understand how to use Python's subprocess module to execute operating system commands.
- Learn to capture and print command outputs within a Python script.
- Understand how to handle errors and different exit codes when running OS commands.

## Tasks
1. Execute basic OS commands (ls or dir) using subprocess.
2. Capture and print standard output and errors.
3. Handle exit codes and errors gracefully.

## Conclusion
In this lab, we automated task executions using Python's subprocess module. 
We successfully executed OS commands, captured their outputs, and handled errors, making scripts more robust and reliable.
