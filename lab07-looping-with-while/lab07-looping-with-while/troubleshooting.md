# Troubleshooting

1. **Infinite loop**
   - Ensure a break condition is present.

2. **KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C)**
   - If you forget 'exit', you can stop the program with Ctrl+C.

3. **IndentationError**
   - Make sure indentation is consistent (4 spaces).

4. **No output**
   - Verify condition logic and print statements.
