# Interview Q&A

1. **Q: What is a while loop?**
A: A loop that executes repeatedly while a condition remains true.

A: Using the `break` statement.

5. **Q: Can we skip an iteration?**
A: Yes, using the `continue` statement.

6. **Q: What is the risk of using while True?**
A: Without a break, it becomes an infinite loop.

7. **Q: Can while loops be nested?**
A: Yes, you can place while loops inside each other.
