# Lab 9 – Working with Lists and Tuples

## Objectives
- Understand the basic properties and operations of lists and tuples in Python.
- Perform operations such as creation, modification, sorting, and deletion on lists.
- Demonstrate the concept of immutability with tuples.
- Differentiate between lists and tuples in Python programming.

## Tasks
### Task 1: Creating and Printing a List
- Create a list of fruits and print it.

### Task 2: Modifying the List
- Append a new fruit.
- Remove one fruit.
- Sort the list.

### Task 3: Demonstrating Lists vs Tuples
- Create a tuple of fruits.
- Attempt to modify it → shows immutability.

## Conclusion
- Lists are **mutable** → we can modify, add, remove, or sort elements.  
- Tuples are **immutable** → any modification attempt throws a `TypeError`.  
- Choosing between lists and tuples depends on whether mutability is required.
