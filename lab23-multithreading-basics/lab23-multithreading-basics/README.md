# Lab 23: Multi-threading Basics

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of multi-threading and its importance in programming.
- Learn to create and manage basic threads using Python's threading module.
- Demonstrate concurrency by running multiple threads simultaneously.
- Identify potential use cases for multi-threading in real-world applications.

## Tasks
1. Write a function executed by threads to print numbers with a delay.
2. Create and run two threads concurrently.
3. Observe interleaved outputs from multiple threads.
4. Discuss real-world use cases.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how to use Python's `threading` module to create concurrent execution flows. 
Both threads executed their tasks in parallel, showcasing concurrency in Python.
