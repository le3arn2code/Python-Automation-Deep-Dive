# Troubleshooting

1. **Python not recognized**
   - Ensure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
   - On Linux/macOS, run `which python3`.

2. **Permission denied when running script**
   - Run `chmod +x script.py` before executing.

3. **Wrong version shows**
   - Run `python3 --version` (sometimes `python` points to Python 2.x on Linux).

4. **IDE not launching**
   - Reinstall VS Code or PyCharm and ensure PATH options are selected.
