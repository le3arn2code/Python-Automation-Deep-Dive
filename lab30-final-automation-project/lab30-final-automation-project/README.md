# Lab 30 â€“ Final Automation Project Example

## Objectives
- Understand basic automation workflows using open-source tools.
- Develop a script to fetch, process, and save data.
- Implement logging, error handling, and CLI arguments.

## Tasks
1. Fetch data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder).
2. Process the data and apply transformations.
3. Save filtered results into a CSV file.
4. Add logging and error handling.
5. Support CLI arguments for flexible use.

## Conclusion
In this lab, you built a complete automation workflow in Python. You practiced API calls, JSON handling, filtering data, writing results to CSV, logging, error handling, and accepting CLI arguments.
