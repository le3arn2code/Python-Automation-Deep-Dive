# Interview Q&A

1. **Q: What is a for loop used for?**
A: Iterating over a sequence like a range, list, or string.

2. **Q: How does range(1, 6) work?**
A: It generates numbers from 1 up to, but not including, 6.

3. **Q: Can you loop over strings?**
A: Yes, each character in the string will be iterated.

4. **Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between for and while loops?**
A: `for` is used when the number of iterations is known; `while` runs until a condition becomes false.

5. **Q: What data structures can be looped over?**
A: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, and ranges.

6. **Q: How do you count iterations in a loop?**
A: Initialize a counter and increment it inside the loop.

7. **Q: What is an iterable in Python?**
A: Any object that can return its elements one at a time.

8. **Q: Can we use break in a for loop?**
A: Yes, to exit the loop early.

9. **Q: Can we use continue in a for loop?**
A: Yes, to skip the current iteration and move to the next.

10. **Q: How to iterate with index and value together?**
A: Use `enumerate(list)` in the loop.
