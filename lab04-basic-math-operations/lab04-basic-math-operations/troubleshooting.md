# Troubleshooting

1. **ValueError when entering numbers**
   - Ensure you enter numeric input, not letters.

2. **Division by zero**
   - The script handles this and prints "Undefined (division by zero)".

3. **File not found**
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory and file is saved as `basic_math_operations.py`.

4. **Python not found**
   - Use `python3` instead of `python`.
